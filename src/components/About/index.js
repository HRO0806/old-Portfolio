                    I am a web developer who is passionate about building sharp and polished 
                    user interfaces. I have a deep interest in web development, as I am naturally 
                    curious. I have been trained to use tools such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, 
                    Bootstrap, Bulma, Node.js, express.js, REACT, and HandleBars. I have recently 
                    graduated from the University of Minnesota's coding Bootcamp. I have learned 
                    a lot through this experience and have become both a better developer and 
                    person because of it. Through this Bootcamp, I have been trained as a 
                    full-stack developer. I showed that I am a team player during this program, 
                    as we had three assignments where we worked as a group. I am also very flexible
                    and open to learning and trying new things. I heavily value the input of 
                    others as I think bringing in other perspectives from people that you trust 
                    creates a better end product.
